React with core reactfire

Reading Object from firebase

https://github.com/firebase/reactfire

Reactfire use mixin which is not support in ES6, therefore we have separate module to suport mixin in ES6

To run this example, data strcuture required in firebase is below

{
    users : {
        "first" : {
            name:"first name",
            age: 45
        },
        "second": {
            name:"second user name",
            age: 20
        }
    }
}




Update below code with your firebase configuraiton in config/index.js

`var firebaseConfig = {

    apiKey: "<API_KEY>",

    authDomain: "<PROJECT_ID>.firebaseapp.com",

    databaseURL: "https://<DATABASE_NAME>.firebaseio.com"
